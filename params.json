This project was crafted and given in the course EECS 3461 at York University under professor Melanie Baljko.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\nThe project's main goal is to create a semi-minimalist but perfectly informative UI that is capable to acquire trends in one's hand grip strength (HGS). Certain trends were discovered in recent studies of elderly with chronic muscle disease. It is shown that certain diseases that involve loss of muscle/bone strength (such as osteoporosis, cerebral palsy, ALS etc.) can be detected early with consistent HGS decay. The challenge is making a UI that is easily accessible yet informative enough to keep the user engaged and content with themselves in self-management, yet technologically advanced enough to make in-depth analysis about one's HGS data. The reasons for self-management are as follows: A key factor in management of chronic disease is the involvement of the individual in the management of his or her treatment plan (self-management and self-care). An individual's involvement in his/her health care is not a matter of knowledge or lack of knowledge, but rather a _complex social phenomena_. This can improve the frequency and motivation for health care visits. That being said, it is recently noticed that there exists a correlation between the elderly's involvement with their health care and their continued desire to attend helpful health care visits. The trouble with tackling this issue is that the elderly can sometimes be intimidated by today's copious amounts of technological changes and the ever increasing amount of \"convinces,\" that frankly confused many elderly trying to do what more technologically advanced people will consider \"standard\" or \"easy\". A possible solution to this problem can be a semi-minimalist interface using influences from Don Norman's _Design of Everyday Things_ and an Arduino to measure data of HGS. \r\n \r\n",
